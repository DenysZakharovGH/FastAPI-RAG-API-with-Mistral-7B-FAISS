# FastAPI-RAG-API-with-Mistral-7B-FAISS
This project is a production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) API built with FastAPI, FAISS, and Mistral-7B-Instruct.  It enables querying custom knowledge bases using semantic search and large language models while maintaining low latency, controlled hallucinations, and clean async architecture.
